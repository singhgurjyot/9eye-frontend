So you order online for some easy junk snack, which leaves you feeling bloated and demotivated about ever eating healthy again.</p>
        <p>For ages, people have promoted eye exercises as a “natural” cure for vision disabilities. Here are a few different eye exercises that you must try.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Eye movements: close your eyes-move your eyes upwards- then downwards-then to the left- then to the right- repeat thrice.</li>
            <li>Focus Change: Hold a finger a few inches away from one eye - focus on your finger- move the finger away from your face slowly - look farther away for a moment - focus on your finger again and slowly move it back closer.</li>
            <li>20-20-20 Rule: focus at something 20 feet away for 20 seconds every 20 minutes (works great for digital eye pain)</li>
            <li>Figure 8:  focus on an area about 8' away, move your eyes in the shape of figure 8 for 30 seconds, and then reverse the direction.</li>
            <li>Palming: Cup an eye in each palm for 30seconds - breathe in and out and feel the tension release- repeat thrice.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>It's not just the exercise that'll help you with your eyesight if not combined with a healthy nutritional diet. When it comes to following a proper diet to fuel up your performance, it’s not as simple as replacing waffles with vegetables. So here's a list of a few best foods for your eyes.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Almonds - These contain vitamin E. Consuming regular amounts of vitamin E can help prevent age-related macular degeneration as well as cataracts. </li>
            <li>Eggs - They contain vitamin A, zinc, zeaxanthin, and lutein, which are all vital to eye health.</li>
            <li>Dairy -  Dairy contains vitamin A along with the mineral zinc. While zinc helps bring it to the eyes from the liver, Vitamin A protects the cornea.</li>
            <li>Carrots - They have vitamin A and  Beta Carotene, which can help prevent eye infections and other severe eye conditions.</li>
            <li>Oranges - Vitamin C, found mainly in fresh fruits like oranges, contributes to healthy blood vessels in your eyes. It combats cataracts development, and in combination with other nutrients and vitamins, age-related macular degeneration.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>There's a possibility that eye exercises and diet won’t benefit you. But it won't hurt to try, right? It’s also advised to get your eyes checked regularly by an eye doctor. They can often detect and treat problems before noticeable symptoms occur. Book an appointment with 9eye now and experience the best in class ophthalmic services.</p>`,

Well, I think it’s time to get to the bottom of all these myths and get some vision facts once and for all because you can’t take care of your eyesight properly if you get caught up in these myths.</p>
        <p>Below we’ve listed some of the top myths about your eyes, with some facts.</p>
        <ol>
        <li>
            <h3>Eating carrots improves eyesight.</h3>
            <h4>False</h4>
            <p>Vitamin A (or retinol) is an essential nutrient to maintain healthy sight. However, the requirement to the body is relatively low and can be easily obtained from green leafy vegetables, dairy and fishes. Even though Carrots are known to be a good source of beta carotene which gets converted into vitamin A, there is no scientific evidence to prove the above statement. So no, eating a dozen carrots won’t give you night vision. </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Sitting near TV harms your eyes.</h3>
            <h4>False</h4>
            <p>We were scolded countless times for sitting too close to the TV, as this supposedly harm our eyes, especially when we were kids, but what most elders do not know is that children have a better near vision that’s why they prefer sitting close to the television, VR makes so much sense now. There are but only short term effects such as headache or discomfort. No long term adverse effects have been found yet.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Reading in dim lights could be harmful.</h3>
            <h4>False</h4>
            <p>Our eyes are cleverly designed to adjust themselves according to the light available. When we are in low light our pupil dilates and allows more amount of light to fall into the lens and vice versa. So reading in low light for a long time will only strain your eyes, though you would be more comfortable reading under a lamp.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Glasses make your eyes weaker.</h3>
            <h4>False</h4>
            <p>Glasses only helps an individual to see their best. They neither make your eyes weaker nor correct your eyesight, or they do so only when you are wearing them. Our eyesight changes naturally and as we got older the eye lens gets thicker and so it can not change focus from distance to near. So our eyes get weaker due to ageing and not because of glasses. </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>No eye exam needed until you have a problem.</h3>
            <h4>False</h4>
            <p>Having an eye exam on a yearly basis is as important as to have a regular health check-up. As the saying goes prevention is better than cure, it equally validates when it comes to your eyes. Doing a yearly eye exam helps you maintain eye health and in earlier detection of diseases, such as high blood pressure, brain tumour and even diabetes which could cause vision loss if untreated. Now understand that an eye exam is different from an eye test/sight test, which is basically performed to prescribe an accurate eyeglass. </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Eye exercise for better vision</h3>
            <h4>False</h4>
            <p>Contrary to popular belief eye exercises can not help in improving your eyesight, however, eye exercise might come handy in relaxing the eye muscles and treating eye muscles problem such as misalignment, known as strabismus, which is just another fancy name for a crossed eye condition. No amount of eye gymnastics can cure near or farsightedness.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>You will outgrow crossed eye.</h3>
            <h4>False</h4>
            <p>We’ve been told not to cross our eyes or we would get crossed eyes, however, crossed eyes are results of nerve damage and can not be caused due to prolonged crossed eye position. Which means you can keep on making that funny face without worrying, but do stop when it starts to hurt.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>You see from your eyes</h3>
            <h4>False</h4>
            <p>Well technically speaking it’s your brain that process the electrical signal from the optic nerve and convert it into what you see. Your eyes are just photo (light) receptors that catch the reflected lights from the objects, convert them into an electrical signal (via retina) and send it to your brain via the optic nerve. Your brain can process an image that eye sees for even 13 milliseconds.</p>
        </li><br />
        <p>These are but not all the myths that surrounds our eyes. Do your research and educate yourself. So next time somebody tells something which is not true you would have an awesome science backed comeback .And remember have faith in science and not in fiction, fiction only looks great in books and movies like Harry Potter (Accio readers, ugh nevermind).</p>

                    <p>Protecting eyes from the harmful ultraviolet rays from the sun is important. It should not only looked as a means of fashion but wearing a hat with a brim, or a scarf/ dupatta can shield your eyes. Wear sunglasses, right prescription glasses with a UV protecting coating.</p>
                    <h3>Use good lighting</h3>
                    <p>For your eyes to be able to function well, your eyes need 3 times as much light when you're 60 as they did when you were 20. Increase the daylight in your home by keeping windows clean and curtains pulled back.<p>
                    <p>Make sure you have good lighting be it from electricity or as sunlight, make a note you have good lighting especially at the top and bottom of stairs so you can see the steps clearly.</p>
                    <p>For reading or close work, use a direct light from a flexible table lamp, positioned so the light isn't reflected by the page causing glare or strain in the eyes.</p>
                    <h3>Exercises supporting old age eyesight:</h3>
                    <h4>Palm the eyes</h4>
                    <p>Palming the eyes helps to relax eye muscles and reduce eye tension. Ask your grandparents to gently place palm of the hands over the eyes without applying any force or pressure. This should be clubbed with taking deep breaths for a couple of minutes.</p>
                    <h4>Look in four directions</h4>
                    <p>Ask your grandparents to stand straight having face in the forward direction and move their eyes to one side and focus on any object. Then repeating this in the opposite direction. Similarly ask them to do this exercise in the upward direction as well as in the downward direction. This exercise will help strengthen optical nerves and muscles.</p>
                    <h4>Tracing</h4>
                    <p>Look at any object within your field of vision and focus on it. Trace the outline of the object in focus. Repeat this exercise 3-4 times a day.</p>
                    <h4>Tracking near and far</h4>
                    <p>Stretch your arm out and make a thumbs-up and then focus on your thumb tip and slowly bring it close to your face at about three inches to your face. Now, staying focusses reverse the action and move your thumb slowly back to its original position. </p><br />
                    <p>Old age people are just like the roots of the trees and the branches are as grandchildren. Therefore, in order to keep these branches nourished and facilitate growth it is the responsibility of the young to take care of the old people so, that they can get going from narrating bed time stories, reading newspaper to talking about their life experiences without any difficulties. </p>
                    <p>Getting them to go for regular eye check-ups and if they want to opt for eye surgeries, it should be followed by consulting the ophthalmologist and discussing with them in detail about the problems faced, past medical records and if there will be any side effects after surgeries. Some surgeries that old age people are likely to get are cataract surgery, laser surgery, trabeculectomy for glaucoma and other. Vision related problems should not be taken for granted as poor vision can result in disturbances in daily life activities, when staying active is the key to maintain health and quality of life of the senior citizens.</p>
                    <p>As far as the eye health of the seniors is concerned, it is essential to encourage healthy lifestyles that boost eye health in the long run. As their golden years and their golden eyes should never lose their shine. </p>
                    <p>We couldn’t do much then but we can surely do it now. Let’s be the driving force that can make a difference in their lives!</p>

        blogTitle: 'Sports for Healthy vision',
        blogPreview: `Waking up late in the morning has become a part of lifestyle and a sporty morning start has somewhat demised from our lives. With this, the urge to do physical activities has been suppressed. With the dozy eyes and half-filled cup of coffee, we forget that we are slowly losing the hold of an elusive situation, which is our physical fitness.`,
        blogText: `<p>Waking up late in the morning has become a part of lifestyle and a sporty morning start has somewhat demised from our lives. With this, the urge to do physical activities has been suppressed. With the dozy eyes and half-filled cup of coffee, we forget that we are slowly losing the hold of an elusive situation, which is our physical fitness.</p>
                    <p>While the fitness gurus and trainers talk about the outer fitness, seldom do they talk about our eye fitness. Many ophthalmologists do point out the need of sports and exercise for eye care but everything goes in vain as soon as we come out of their clinic. Little did we know that there is a field of specialization in sports vision, which aims at increasing the response time of eyes while playing any sport. Just as constant exercise increase one’s speed and accuracy, studies suggest that they can also improve one’s visual speed and accuracy. A Fun Fact! Do you know, 80% of sensory input in sports is visual? To further strengthen the above claim, let us consider a scenario. Imagine a person wants to grow his biceps and other muscular organ for any tournament or just for fitness. He might spend few hours hitting gym every day. Now, after few months, he might get desired shape of muscle. Similarly our eyes have a network of various tissues and muscles known as ciliary muscle which can be strengthened by doing appropriate exercises. Intriguing isn’t it?</p>
                    <p>Not only the betterment but some studies have found that exercise is directly related to reduced risk of glaucoma, cataract, wet-age macular degeneration and others. We hardly ever see any athlete, in his old age, wearing any prescription glasses, and lot can be attributed to the fact that they play light sport even in their late years. According to a 2016 study, lack of physical exercise may be associated with increased risk of cataract. Another study suggests that exercise and sports are equally effective in treating glaucoma. Doctors treat glaucoma by reducing high intraocular eye pressure but similar results can be achieved by playing a game which includes high vision perception.</p>
                    <p>Not only this, other ailments like diabetes and high blood pressure can also significantly damage our eyes, and can make us blind. So in that case doctors suggest exercise. So if you are someone who is suffering from these problems, then sports and exercise should be at the top of your bucket list. Diabetes can severely damage the retinal nerves hence it is highly recommended to do light exercise in this condition.</p>
                    <h4>So What Can You Do?</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>You should eat nutritious food and visit doctor regularly for check-ups.</li>
                        <li>You should exercise everyday as it is beneficial for body, mind as well as your eye.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Compromising on any of the point can give you some gruesome result and you can be devoid of this ubiquitous yet precious resource.</p>
                    <p>Many studies have correlated exercise and better vision. So, it makes sense to stay active and play a lot of sports. We can’t miss the fact that sportsperson undergoes various sports’ vision test, for example, alignment test, visual processing speed test, eye dominance test etc, but sports is equally important for everyone on this earth and should be played with zeal and zest for better health and vision. Your mission should be to have better vision.</p>

Generally, people suffering from chronic disease or other disorders are seen to develop eye problems. Disease and disorders are enough of a problem to oneself but they side affecting our other parts totally unrelated to them causes much more health concern. Here we will see many common diseases and disorders that indirectly affect the health of your eye.</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            <h3>Diabetes</h3>
                            <p>Diabetes is one of the most common diseases that people suffer from almost 10.5% population suffers from diabetes i.e. High blood sugar levels. If the condition is not controlled a the patient has a risk of developing diabetic retinopathy. In it, the blood vessels of the eye leak to the retina and if prolonged could lead to blindness. Being diabetic also increases the risk of developing cataracts and glaucoma.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <h3>High Blood Pressure</h3>
                            <p>High BP is also a major disease that is common in today’s world. High BP or hypertension can affect many of our organs. High BP affects the retina of our eyes and a condition called hypertensive retinopathy. High BP can affect your eye in a similar way as of diabetes. The blood vessels could burst and have leakage in the eyes causing blindness. The longer this condition is neglected the longer person is prone to eye disease.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <h3>Sickel Cell Disease</h3>
                            <p>Vision impairment or complete vision failure is a great side effect of this disease. SCD is a genetically passed disease and proper precautions must be taken as it could be detected very early on. The odd-shaped cell tends to coagulate in the blood vessels present in the eye causing vision impairment.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <h3>Shingles</h3>
                            <p>Shingles is a disease in which rashes and blisters occur all over the body. If the face or part near the eyes is affected by this disease can cause serious problem including pain in eyes inflammation around the external part of the eye and swollen eyelids. </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <h3>Malnutrition</h3>
                            <p>A balanced diet is the perfect way for a healthy life. Due to malnourishment, many diseases like diabetes and High BP can take place not only that but due to the absence of multiple required vitamins like A, B, and essential minerals like zinc and lutein can affect the condition severely. For a healthy eye, a balanced diet is most essential, and only taking any vitamin and mineral can not nurse it back to health.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <h3>Liver Disease</h3>
                            <p>Multiple liver diseases can result in eye disease. Disease like cirrhosis can result in multiple problems as liver disease is often accompanied by a huge change in hormone and body fat levels. Which could, in turn, have problems like fat deposition on eyelids that could in turn damage cornea and lens.</li>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <h3>Autoimmune Conditions</h3>
                            <p>Autoimmune diseases are one of the diseases that have a high chance of affecting your eyes. In fact, the doctor often first check if the patient is not suffering from any autoimmune disease while reporting eye-related problems. At first, the common symptoms include red eye, itchy eyes, dry eyes. If the condition is not looked into and treatment is prolonged it could result in eye pain, vision sensitivity, and even vision loss.</p>

Likewise our eyes “cries for help” by showing not so subtle signs , whenever there is any sort of discomfort. We must heed into this. So ,let’s identify these signs and problems associated with them.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <h3>Flashy lights and floaters</h3>
                            <p>For millennial flashy lights and floaters in a bright sunny day could mean an awesome pool party, but if your parents or elderly are having these signs in their field of vision, it could be worrisome. Flashy of lights and floaters occurs at the corner, of the peripheral vision. This condition gets more common by ageing. It is due to the changes occurred in the vitreous gel. While most of the time it only hinders with your field of vision. However, if there is sudden increase the number of floaters and flashes ,it could be a warning sign of retinal tear or detachment, which is a blinding condition if not treated timely , consult retinal expert immediately.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <h3>Blurry vision</h3>
                            <p>While Rohit had Jadu, an alien( from koi mil Gaya) to treat his blurry vision , we have experienced opticians and corrective lenses to do the job adequately. Most of the times blurry visions results due to abnormalities like myopia (nearsightedness) , hyperopia(farsightedness) or presbyopia. But a sudden blurriness could be a warning sign for other underlying aliments. If you’re experiencing double vision , sudden painless changes in eyesight along with blurry vision, call for a doctor as it might be a sign of stroke (other signs of stroke includes dizziness, loss of balance , slurred speech). Blurry vision along with double vision, dizziness , fatigue , imbalance, could be a sign of multiple sclerosis which needs medical attention.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <h3>Itchy eyes</h3>
                            <p>It’s not advised for you to rub your eyes, but sometimes to get rid of that annoying itchiness, we tend to rub them. Itchy eyes could be caused for numerous reasons like, seasonal allergies, bacterial or viral infection (might be due to rubbing, what a vicious cycle?). Other reasons for itchy eyes might be because of something in your eyes , if there is a foreign object in your eyes ,it can cause irritation , itchiness and pain , again rubbing or scratching won’t be of any help. “scratching at a foreign object can result in corneal abrasion, which increases the risk of  infection and can lead to corneal scarring” Jaequot warns. It would help if you splash some clean water onto your opened eyes.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <h3>Eye pain</h3>
                            <p>Pain in the eyes , generally means some persistent discomfort in one or both the eyes ,the pain could be felt on ,in behind or around the eyes. Now the thing is severity of eye pain does not usually indicate the seriousness of the underlying cause, which is worrisome, as serious problems like cataract , glaucoma , macular degeneration does not cause any eye pain, but a minor problem such as superficial abrasion on cornea ( just a scratch, by the way) could be painful.</p>
                            <p>If the pain is in or on your eyes , this could be due to corneal abrasion ( again a scratch) or a foreign body , both of them have potential to cause infection ,also it is not possible to tell whether it is a superficial or deep abrasion. It’s better to consult a doctor.</p>
                            <p>If you’re feeling pain behind the eye ,it could be because of migraine headache and sinus infection, pain caused by sinus infection is less severe than that of migraine, these pain signs typically does not means an emergency. However, it is chronic and reoccurring consult your opticians or physician.</p>
                            <p>The common reason for pain around eye are stye and blepharitis or the increased screen time, these usually does not required medical attention. But a much serious and less common reason for the pain could be optic neuropathy, which can cause vision loss ,besides the pain around the eye other symptoms include decreased visual activity and reduced colour vision.</p>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>The purpose of this blog is not to create panic about some insignificant changes which would go away with time , but to aware you about what these signs could mean if they are prolonged or persistent. It is difficult to experience the world's  bounty without our eyes , just close your eyes and the world you know disappears, So it is important to take good care for them, look closely if you notice anything unusual about your eyes , consult your opticians or book one here at 9eye.</p>
